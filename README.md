UWP downloader made in Java, ideal for those who have a restricted system or older versions of Windows.

**WARNING:** This project was made to learn, it is one of my first times using Java and it is my first non-vibecoded GUI as AI was exclusively used to bugfix this release and some suggestions. 
While I learned many things, this is not the cleanest project and it is possible for errors to occur, I tried to keep the program as functional and efficient as possible, but if sometimes an icon does not load or something seems out of place, blame multithreading and restart the app :p

This works by constructing an URL just like Microsoft does for their store and parsing the recieved json for information on programs, then requesting the related files from [RG-adguard](https://store.rg-adguard.net/), this means that if files are missing I am not responsible, but nearly everythring I tried to download works apart from a few games. The Download Manager has features to try to make getting the apps in an organized manner easier, but if some package has a name that does not follow the expected format, it may fail to appear. This is precisely the reason there are so many checkboxes (and buttons that disable this check), so you can get the desired app.

You can always just get the ID through the app and paste it on the site, a workflow which some may prefer. I am open to criticism on the work and scructure. Feel free to roast me if you want to!
